/**
 * <h3>PeregrineOpMode is the basic class that all opModes extend from, replacing LinearOpMode in
 * the normal FTC SDK.</h3>
 *
 * <p>Every autonomous and teleop extends PeregrineOpMode directly and adds the usual
 * {@code @Autonomous} or {@code @TeleOp} annotation. At INIT it builds the hardware, localizer,
 * global variables, telemetry and (unless {@link #buildOptimalityEngine()} is overridden to return
 * false) the OptimalityEngine, then asks you for your task tree with {@link #defineTasks()}. After
 * START it runs that tree, alongside the Localizer, once per loop until the tree finishes or the
 * opMode is stopped.</p>
 *
 * <p>It also provides a universal interface that tasks use, through their {@code opMode} field, to
 * access the robot's hardware, its position, telemetry, the gamepads, and any global variables that
 * you may choose to add to the GlobalVariables class.</p>
