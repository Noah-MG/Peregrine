# The SD card
{: .no_toc }

The pathing tables and the drivetrain model are too big to ship inside the app, so they live on a
microSD card in the Control Hub.

## Formatting

Format the card as **FAT32**. A card the Control Hub can't mount shows up as
`SD Card not mounted, did you format it to FAT32?` on telemetry.

Tables for a full-resolution grid can run to several gigabytes per target, so use a large, reasonably
fast card.

## What goes on it

Everything sits at the **root** of the card:

```
/MANIFEST.JSON          what's on the card: grid, encoding, list of targets
/MODEL.JSON             the fitted drivetrain model and the honing PID gains
/TABLES/T00C0000.BIN    target 00, chunk 0000
/TABLES/T00C0001.BIN    target 00, chunk 0001
/TABLES/T01C0000.BIN    target 01, chunk 0000
...
```

You never write these by hand. The desktop solver (`peregrine-desktop`) generates all of them.
Copy them onto the card exactly as it outputs them.

The robot also creates this folder on the card, for [calibration](calibration.md) logs:

```
/Android/data/com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller/files/logs/
```

## Checking a card

Before a match, run the desktop project's verifier against the card:

```bash
py -3.12 wizard/verify_tables.py G:\
```

(Replace `G:\` with wherever the card is mounted.) It checks file counts and sizes, checksums, that
the model is valid, and that the values make physical sense.

## What the robot does with it

- At INIT, the robot reads `MANIFEST.JSON` and `MODEL.JSON` and opens every table file.
- It checks that the tables are in the field frame and use a supported storage type (`u8`, `u16`,
  `f16` or `f32`). `u16` is the default and the recommended choice.
- While driving, it reads 7 values per loop from the files that are already open.
- At STOP, it closes the files.

If anything is missing or invalid, a message appears on telemetry and the opMode stops. See
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

## Swapping cards

Power the Control Hub off before removing or inserting a card. The new tables are picked up the next
time an opMode is initialised.

## The full format

The byte-level format (manifest fields, indexing, encoding, the drivetrain model and the honing gains)
is specified in `TABLE_FORMAT.MD`, which ships with the desktop solver. You only need it if you are
changing the solver or the robot's table reader.
